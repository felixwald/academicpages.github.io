Hi! I am Felix a research associate pursuing my PhD at the Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Germany. \n I am part of the research group [Real-time Systems for Energie Technologies](https://www.itep.kit.edu/rtset/english/index.php) based in the Institute for Technical Physics. \n My current research revolves around the future power grid with high amounts of renewables and the integration of inverter-based resources (IBRs). In particular I investigate the possible challenges and opportunities of integrating Solid-State Transformers (SST) into the power system. You can find more details at [publications](/publications/).
